    - "I am pursuing a **Master's Degree in Data Science** at **University of Michigan - Dearborn** (expected May 2027) with a cumulative GPA of 4.0."
    - "I have 3+ years of professional experience in Data Science and Analytics before moving to the United States to pursue my Master’s. My most recent role was Data Analyst at **Gearlaunch**, a global US-based company in the e-commerce and print-on-demand industry, where I was the **sole data analyst** responsible for the entire company’s analytics system. Prior to that, I worked at **VCCORP**, <u><a href=\"https://www.emis.com/php/company-profile/VN/Vccorp_Corporation__Cong_Ty_Co_Phan_Vccorp___Cong_Ty_Co_Phan_Vccorp__Vccorp_Corporation___en_9204447.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vietnam’s leading tech company with the largest digital media ecosystem</a></u>, first as a Data Analyst and later promoted to **Data Analyst - Team Lead** for a team of four, responsible for analytical growth of 7 media sites."
    - "I specialize in **analytic** disciplines, including designing statistical experiments, building predictive models, deploying automated dashboards (Tableau, Google Cloud Platform), and implementing data-driven solutions such as recommendation systems and web scraping pipelines. My technical skill set includes **Python, R, SQL, Tableau, Google Cloud**, and **Machine Learning**. With my Master’s specialized in Computational Intelligence, I am sharpening my skills in **advanced AI and Machine Learning**, including **Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Large Language Models**, as well as **full-cycle data product deployment.**"
    - "I'm a enthusiastic learner (I built this portfolio website entirely on my own, with ZERO experience in CSS and JS!). I self-taught myself into a career in data and landed my first Data Analyst job when I was third-year undergraduate business student, then got promoted to Data Analyst - Team Lead just one month after graduation. With an incoming Master’s Degree in Data Science, I am eager to continue bringing curiosity, discipline, and drive to every project and grow as a data science professional."
